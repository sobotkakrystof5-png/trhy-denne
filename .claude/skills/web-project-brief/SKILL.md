name: web-project-brief
description: Generates a pair of documents for briefing a client website into Claude Code — a detailed PROJECT-BRIEF prompt (design, tech stack, structure, content, functional requirements) and a CLAUDE.md (persistent behavior and context across sessions). Use this skill whenever the user wants to prepare a brief/prompt for Claude Code to build a client website, a custom marketing site, a landing page, or a multi-page site — even if phrased differently, like "put together a brief", "write up a spec for Claude Code", "make me a CLAUDE.md", or when the user describes a new client and their company with the intent of building them a website. Also trigger when the user just says something like "new client, same process as last time" — this is meant to be a repeatable process, not something rewritten from scratch each time.

# Web Project Brief — Claude Code brief generator

This skill was distilled from two real projects (a craftsperson with a personal story, built on Next.js as a multi-page site; an established LLC-type company, built on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS as a landing page) and generalizes what worked in both into a repeatable process. Goal: turn a conversation with the user about a new client into two artifacts — `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` (a detailed prompt for Claude Code) and `CLAUDE.md` (persistent behavior rules + context for that repo).

**The core principle this skill protects above all else:** the resulting website must not look like an "AI template". That is the heart of section 0 in both templates and must never be weakened or dropped when generating a new brief — it is the single most valuable thing carried over from the earlier projects.

## When and how to trigger

This skill is for **starting a new client website project**. If the user just wants to edit an already-existing `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, edit those files directly (see "Editing an existing brief" below) — don't start over from the templates.

## Process

### 1. Gather the missing information (a conversation, not a checklist to tick off)

If the conversation already contains enough information (the user uploaded a logo, pasted company copy, stated a tech stack), don't re-ask — just fill in the gaps. Ask concisely about what actually shapes the document's structure:

- **Client and content:** company name, industry, how long they've been in business, contact details, any source text about the company (never invent facts — if the client didn't state a number of projects/clients, don't make one up).
- **Logo/visuals:** does the client have a logo? What colors does it suggest? Does it need background removal or reformatting?
- **Tone:** does the company have a personal story (a founder, a craftsperson), or is it an established business with no need for storytelling? This directly determines whether sections 1 and 4 of the template include a timeline/storytelling section — don't force a personal narrative where there's no material for it.
- **Structure:** landing page (scroll + anchors), or multi-page site (routing, separate URLs)? If this isn't clear from context, ask.
- **Tech stack:** Next.js/React, or plain HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, or something else? If a service requiring an API key (Resend, Stripe, anything) comes up alongside a vanilla/static stack — **flag this immediately**: it needs at least one thin serverless function, since the key can't live in client-side code. Don't let this surface only during implementation.
- **Photos:** available now, or is this still a design draft with placeholders? Roughly how many (portfolio, gallery)?
- **Skills/tools:** does the user want to use a specific design skill (e.g. frontend-design) or a custom skill they have locally in Claude Code? If so, mention it in the brief as a note for Claude Code, but don't duplicate another skill's content — just reference it.

If the answer to "landing page vs. multi-page" or "tech stack" is unclear and would fundamentally change the document's structure, ask via `ask_user_input_v0` (2–3 short questions), the same way as in the two prior projects — don't guess on the user's behalf; this is an irreversible decision that would otherwise mean rewriting the whole document later.

### 2. Fill in the templates

Use `assets/project-brief-template.md` and `assets/claude-md-template.md` as the base skeleton. Replace the placeholders (`{{...}}`) with real content. Rules for filling them in:

- **Never shorten or weaken section 0 (anti-AI-template) in the project-brief template** — it's the single most important part and must stay concrete (what to avoid + what to do instead + a custom visual motif tied to the client's industry, not something generic).
- **{{DOMAIN_VISUAL_INSPIRATION}}** — come up with a concrete visual motif idea based on the client's industry (for metalwork/locksmithing, e.g. a weld seam, a technical drawing, dimension lines — but for a different industry, find a different, industry-specific inspiration, not a recycled one).
- **Structure (sections 3–4 of the brief):** fill in either the multi-page variant (route list) or the landing-page variant (anchor list) — never leave both, never leave conflicting instructions in place at once.
- **CLAUDE.md section 5 (Project status)** should be filled in with sensible defaults even on first creation (e.g. "Current phase: design draft, awaiting client approval") — this section is new relative to both prior projects and functions as a log that must be **updated in every subsequent session**, not just once at setup. Tell the user this explicitly so they know to keep coming back to this file.
- Never invent facts about the client (client counts, years of experience, specific prices) if the user didn't provide them — leave a placeholder or ask.

### 3. Create both files and save them under clear, project-specific names

- `{client-slug}-claude-code-prompt.md` (or `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`, if the user prefers a generic name for the project root)
- `CLAUDE.md` — if the user already has a `CLAUDE.md` from another project in the current outputs directory, **don't silently overwrite it** — name the new file differently (e.g. `CLAUDE-{client-slug}.md`) and note that it should be renamed to `CLAUDE.md` once placed in that project's own repo root, since that's the filename Claude Code loads automatically.

Present both files to the user (`present_files`), and briefly summarize what's inside and which key choices (structure, stack, tone) you made based on the conversation — not as a long report, just a few sentences.

### Editing an existing brief

If the user wants to modify an already-created `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (not start a new project), don't route it back through the templates — find the specific file, edit it targeted (`str_replace`), and above all **check whether the change conflicts with another part of the document** (a classic case: changing the structure from landing page to multi-page must also be reflected in sections 3, 4, and CLAUDE.md section 4 — not just the part the user was looking at). This is a real mistake to avoid — in the prior projects, a structure change had to be propagated to multiple places across both documents at once.

## When unsure

Same rule that lives inside the generated documents themselves: if you're unsure about the client's industry, the tone to use, or whether a visual idea is too generic — ask, don't guess. This skill exists primarily to protect the quality and originality of the output, not speed.
